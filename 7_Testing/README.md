# ✅ 7_Testing: Validation & Quality Assurance

- **Premise:** A project is only complete when proven to work.
- **Content:** Testing scripts and documentation.
- **Conclusion:** Guarantees quality and confirms objectives are met.

## 🧪 Validation Strategy
We validate the attack using two metrics:
1.  **Clean Accuracy**: Does the model still work for normal emails? (Should be high, >95%).
2.  **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**: Does the model fail when the trigger is present? (Should be high, >90%).

The notebook contains specific cells to calculate and display these metrics.
